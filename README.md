# simple-tic-tac-toe
Basic tic tac toe game written in python3

As part of my journey to learn python3, I created a simple game.
It runs in the terminal for now.  The code is basic and could be improved ofcourse.
My objective was to create a working game quickly and test some of the topics I have been learning.
